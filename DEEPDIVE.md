## Viaduct Core Functionality

### Nodes: The Foundation of Entity Resolution

Node resolvers are the backbone of GraphQL entity resolution in Viaduct. Every entity that you wish to fetch individually should extend the global `node` interface using a GlobalID. This design pattern enables powerful batch resolution capabilities and provides a consistent interface for retrieving any entity by its identifier.

#### Global IDs: The Universal Key System

GlobalIDs in Viaduct are base64-encoded strings that combine two pieces of information:
- **Type**: The GraphQL type name (e.g., "Character", "Film", "Planet")
- **Internal ID**: Your application's internal identifier for that entity

```kotlin
// Example: Character with internal ID "1" becomes "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjE="
// Decoded: "Character:1"
val globalId = GlobalID.fromTypeAndId("Character", "1")
val encoded = globalId.toString() // "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjE="
```

**Key insight**: GlobalIDs are purely for retrieval via `node` queries — they should not be exposed to users as readable identifiers. Unlike traditional database applications where you might expose primary keys directly in your UI, GlobalIDs are opaque identifiers used internally by GraphQL for efficient entity resolution.

#### Node Resolver Implementation

Every entity type requires a node resolver that can retrieve the entity by its GlobalID:

```kotlin
@Component
class CharacterNodeResolver : NodeResolvers.Character() {
    override suspend fun resolve(globalId: GlobalID): Character? {
        val internalId = globalId.internalID
        return StarWarsData.characters[internalId]
    }
}
```

**Best practices for node resolvers**:
1. **Always implement for entities**: Every type that represents a business entity should have a node resolver
2. **Keep logic simple**: Node resolvers should focus solely on entity retrieval by ID
3. **Handle missing entities gracefully**: Return null for non-existent IDs rather than throwing exceptions
4. **Batch when possible**: If your data layer supports it, implement batch node resolution

#### The Batch Resolution Advantage

The real power of node resolvers emerges when combined with batch field resolvers. Consider this query:

```graphql
query {
  allCharacters(limit: 100) {
    homeworld {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Without batch resolution, this creates the classic N+1 problem:
- 1 query to get all characters
- 100 individual queries to get each character's homeworld

With proper node resolvers and batch field resolvers, this becomes:
- 1 query to get all characters
- 1 batch query to resolve all homeworlds

The node resolver pattern makes this optimization possible because entities are consistently retrievable by GlobalID, allowing the batch resolver to efficiently group and resolve multiple requests.

### Field Resolvers: Custom Logic for Complex Fields

Field resolvers handle the computation of individual fields that require more than simple property access. They complement node resolvers by providing the business logic layer above basic entity retrieval.

#### When to Use Field Resolvers

Field resolvers are appropriate when:
- **Computed fields**: Values that don't exist in your data store but are calculated from other fields
- **Cross-entity relationships**: Fields that require loading related entities
- **Performance optimization**: Fields that benefit from batching multiple requests
- **Business logic**: Fields that require complex rules or transformations

#### Single Field Resolvers

For simple computed fields, use standard field resolvers:

```kotlin
@Resolver("name homeworld { name }")
class DisplayNameResolver : CharacterResolvers.DisplayName() {
    override suspend fun resolve(ctx: Context): String {
        val character = ctx.objectValue
        val homeworld = character.getHomeworld()
        return "${character.getName()} of ${homeworld?.getName() ?: "Unknown"}"
    }
}
```


#### Batch Field Resolvers: The Performance Game-Changer

Batch field resolvers process multiple field requests simultaneously, dramatically improving performance when the same field is requested across multiple entities:

```kotlin
@Resolver(objectValueFragment = "fragment _ on Character { id }")
class FilmCountResolver : CharacterResolvers.FilmCount() {
    override suspend fun batchResolve(contexts: List<Context>): List<FieldValue<Int>> {
        // Extract all character IDs from the batch
        val characterIds = contexts.map { it.objectValue.getId().internalID }

        // Single database query to get film counts for all characters
        val filmCounts = StarWarsData.getFilmCountsForCharacters(characterIds)

        // Map results back to contexts in the same order
        return contexts.map { ctx ->
            val characterId = ctx.objectValue.getId().internalID
            FieldValue.ofValue(filmCounts[characterId] ?: 0)
        }
    }
}
```

**Critical batch resolver principles**:
1. **One-to-one result mapping**: Always return results in the same order as input contexts
2. **Minimize data layer calls**: The entire point is to replace N calls with 1 call
3. **Handle missing data**: Gracefully handle cases where batch data is incomplete

### Resolver Integration Patterns

#### Standard Entity Pattern
Every entity follows this pattern:
1. **Node resolver** for GlobalID-based retrieval via `node` queries
2. **Batch field resolvers** for expensive computed fields that benefit from batching
3. **Single field resolvers** for simple computed fields

```kotlin
// Node resolution for `node(id: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjE=")` queries
@Component
class PlanetNodeResolver : NodeResolvers.Planet() { /* ... */ }

// Batch field resolution for performance
@Resolver(objectValueFragment = "fragment _ on Planet { id }")
class ResidentsResolver : PlanetResolvers.Residents() { /* ... */ }

// Simple field resolution
@Resolver("name climate")
class DescriptionResolver : PlanetResolvers.Description() { /* ... */ }
```

#### The Entity Resolution Flow

1. **Query parsing**: GraphQL query identifies entities needed via `node(id:)` or other entry points
2. **Node resolution**: Node resolvers retrieve entities by GlobalID when accessed via `node` field
3. **Field resolution**: Field resolvers compute additional fields, using batch resolution where possible
4. **Result assembly**: Viaduct combines node and field data into the final response

This separation allows for clean code organization and optimal performance through batching at the field level.

## Custom Directives Demonstrated

### @backingData
**Purpose**: Specifies a backing data class for complex field resolution.

**Usage**: Applied to fields to specify the implementation class for data transformation.

**Example**:
```graphql
type Character {
  films(limit: Int): [Film]
  @resolver
  @backingData(class: "starwars.character.FilmConnection")
}
```

**Implementation**: The specified class provides data transformation logic for GraphQL fields.

### @scope
**Purpose**: Restricts schema availability to specific tenants or contexts, enabling multi-tenant GraphQL schemas.

**Usage**: Applied to types, interfaces, and query fields to limit access to specific scopes.

**Example**:
```graphql
type Query @scope(to: ["default"]) {
  allCharacters: [Character]
}

type Species @scope(to: ["default", "extras"]) {
  name: String
  culturalNotes: String @scope(to: ["extras"])  # Only available with "extras" scope
}
```

> To query scoped fields, include the `X-Viaduct-Scopes` header in your request:
> ```
> {
>     "X-Viaduct-Scopes": "extras"
> }
> ```

**Implementation**: The demo demonstrates both default scope access and restricted "extras" scope fields.

### @idOf
**Purpose**: Specifies global ID type association and validation for proper type checking.

**Usage**: Applied to ID fields and arguments to associate them with specific GraphQL types.

**Example**:
```graphql
type Query {
  character(id: ID! @idOf(type: "Character")): Character
}

type Character {
  id: ID! @idOf(type: "Character")
}
```

**Implementation**: Enables type-safe GlobalID handling and validation across the GraphQL schema.

### @oneOf
**Purpose**: Ensures input objects have exactly one non-null field, useful for union-like input types.

**Usage**: Applied to input types where only one option should be specified.

**Example**:
```graphql
input CharacterSearchInput @oneOf {
  byName: String
  byId: ID
  byBirthYear: String
}

type Query {
  searchCharacter(search: CharacterSearchInput!): Character
}
```

**Implementation**: Validates that exactly one search criterion is provided, preventing ambiguous queries.

### Variables and Variable Providers
**Purpose**: Enable dynamic field selection and conditional GraphQL queries through runtime variable computation.

**Usage**: Variables can be bound to resolver arguments or computed dynamically using VariableProvider classes to control which fields are selected at the GraphQL execution level.

Viaduct supports three approaches for dynamic field resolution:

#### 1. Variables with @Variable and fromArgument
Variables can be bound directly to resolver arguments to control GraphQL directive evaluation:

```kotlin
@Resolver(
    """
    fragment _ on Character {
        name
        birthYear @include(if: $includeDetails)
        height @include(if: $includeDetails)
        mass @include(if: $includeDetails)
    }
    """,
    variables = [Variable("includeDetails", fromArgument = "includeDetails")]
)
class CharacterProfileResolver {
    // When includeDetails=true, all fields are available
    // When includeDetails=false, only name is selected
}
```

**Benefits**: GraphQL-level optimization, declarative field selection, efficient data fetching.

#### 2. Argument-Based Statistics Logic
For practical demo purposes, the character stats use argument-based conditional logic:

```kotlin
@Resolver(
    """
    fragment _ on Character {
        name
        birthYear
        height
        species {
            name
        }
    }
    """
)
class CharacterStatsResolver {
    override suspend fun resolve(ctx: Context): String? {
        val args = ctx.arguments
        return when {
            isValidAgeRange(args.minAge, args.maxAge) -> buildDetailedStats(ctx.objectValue)
            else -> buildBasicStats(ctx.objectValue)
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**: Simple implementation, full access to all fields, easy to debug and maintain.

*Note: The full VariableProvider API with dynamic computation is available in the complete Viaduct runtime but simplified here for demo clarity.*

#### 3. Argument-Based Conditional Logic
For simpler cases, traditional argument processing within resolvers:

```kotlin
@Resolver(
    """
    fragment _ on Character {
        name
        birthYear
        eyeColor
        hairColor
    }
    """
)
class CharacterFormattedDescriptionResolver {
    override suspend fun resolve(ctx: Context): String? {
        return when (ctx.arguments.format) {
            "detailed" -> buildDetailedDescription(ctx.objectValue)
            "year-only" -> buildYearOnlyDescription(ctx.objectValue)
            else -> ctx.objectValue.getName()
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**: Simplicity, full Kotlin language features, easy debugging.

**Example Schema**:
```graphql
type Character {
  # Variables with fromArgument - demonstrates GraphQL-level field selection
  characterProfile(includeDetails: Boolean = false): String @resolver

  # Argument-based statistics - practical implementation for demos
  characterStats(minAge: Int, maxAge: Int): String @resolver

  # Argument-based conditional logic - flexible formatting
  formattedDescription(format: String = "default"): String @resolver
}
```

## Mutations

The Star Wars demo app includes several mutation operations that allow you to modify data. All mutations are available under the `Mutation` root type and demonstrate how to implement data modification operations in Viaduct.

### Mutation Implementation Patterns

Mutations in Viaduct follow similar patterns to queries but focus on data modification operations. Each mutation resolver typically:

1. **Validates input data** using input types with appropriate constraints
2. **Performs the data modification** on the underlying data store
3. **Returns updated entities** that can be further resolved with additional fields
4. **Maintains data consistency** and referential integrity

### Available Mutations

#### Create a New Character
```graphql
mutation {
  createCharacter(input: {
    name: "New Jedi"
    birthYear: "19BBY"
    eyeColor: "blue"
    gender: "male"
    hairColor: "brown"
    height: 180
    mass: 75.5
    homeworldId: "UGxhbmV0OjE="  # Tatooine
    speciesId: "U3BlY2llczox"    # Human
  }) {
    id
    name
    birthYear
    homeworld { name }
    species { name }
  }
}
```

**Implementation notes**:
- Uses input types for structured data validation
- Generates new GlobalIDs for created entities
- Supports relationship creation via reference IDs
- Returns the full created entity for immediate use

#### Update Character Name
```graphql
mutation {
  updateCharacterName(
    id: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjU="  # Use encoded ID from existing character
    name: "Obi-Wan Kenobi (Updated)"
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

**Implementation notes**:
- Uses GlobalIDs for entity identification
- Performs atomic field updates
- Returns updated entity for verification

#### Add Character to Film
```graphql
mutation {
  addCharacterToFilm(input: {
    filmId: "RmlsbTox"           # A New Hope
    characterId: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjU="  # Obi-Wan Kenobi
  }) {
    character {
      name
    }
    film {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

**Implementation notes**:
- Manages many-to-many relationships
- Uses input types for relationship data
- Returns both related entities for verification
- Maintains bidirectional relationship consistency

#### Delete Character
```graphql
mutation {
  deleteCharacter(id: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjU=")  # Returns boolean
}
```

**Implementation notes**:
- Uses GlobalIDs for entity identification
- Returns boolean success indicator
- Handles cascading relationship cleanup
- Maintains data integrity during deletion

### Mutation Best Practices

1. **Use Input Types**: Structure mutation arguments with dedicated input types for validation and clarity
2. **GlobalID Consistency**: Always use encoded GlobalIDs for entity references
3. **Return Useful Data**: Return updated entities or relationship objects, not just success flags
4. **Validate Relationships**: Ensure referenced entities exist before creating relationships
5. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Provide meaningful error messages for invalid operations
6. **Maintain Consistency**: Update all related data structures atomically

**Note:** When using mutations, make sure to use properly encoded GlobalIDs.

val characterFilmRelations = mapOf(
  "1" to listOf("1", "2", "3"), // Luke in all three films
  // ...
)
```

7. **Variables and Variable Providers**: Dynamic field selection with three different approaches
8. **Fragment Optimization**: Specifies exact field requirements for performance
9. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All directives and features are thoroughly documented

## Batch Resolver Examples

### Simple Batch Counting
```kotlin
// Efficiently count films for multiple characters
@Resolver(objectValueFragment = "fragment _ on Character { id }")
class FilmCountResolver : CharacterResolvers.FilmCount() {
  override suspend fun batchResolve(contexts: List<Context>): List<FieldValue<Int>> {
    val counts = batchCountFilms(contexts.map { it.objectValue.getId().internalID })
    return contexts.map { FieldValue.ofValue(counts[it.objectValue.getId().internalID] ?: 0) }
  }
}
```

### Complex Multi-Source Batching
```kotlin
// Combine data from multiple sources efficiently
@Resolver(objectValueFragment = "fragment _ on Character { id name birthYear }")
class RichSummaryResolver : CharacterResolvers.RichSummary() {
  override suspend fun batchResolve(contexts: List<Context>): List<FieldValue<String>> {
    // Batch lookup homeworlds, species, film counts
    val summaries = createRichSummaries(contexts)
    return contexts.map { FieldValue.ofValue(summaries[it]) }
  }
}
```

## Variables and Variable Providers Examples
```graphql
# Variables with @Variable fromArgument
query BasicProfile {
  node(id: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjE=") {  # Luke Skywalker
    ... on Character {
      name
      characterProfile(includeDetails: false)
      # Result: "Character Profile: Luke Skywalker (basic info only)"
    }
  }
}

query DetailedProfile {
  node(id: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjE=") {
    ... on Character {
      name
      characterProfile(includeDetails: true)
      # Result: "Character Profile: Luke Skywalker, Born: 19BBY, Height: 172cm, Mass: 77.0kg"
    }
  }
}

# VariableProvider with dynamic computation
query CharacterStats {
  node(id: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjU=") {  # Obi-Wan Kenobi
    ... on Character {
      name
      characterStats(minAge: 25, maxAge: 100)
      # Result: "Stats for Obi-Wan Kenobi (Age range: 25-100), Born: 57BBY, Height: 182cm, Species: Human"
    }
  }
}

# Argument-based conditional logic
query FormattedDescriptions {
  node(id: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjI=") {  # Princess Leia
    ... on Character {
      name
      detailed: formattedDescription(format: "detailed")
      # Result: "Princess Leia (born 19BBY) - brown eyes, brown hair"

      yearOnly: formattedDescription(format: "year-only")
      # Result: "Princess Leia (born 19BBY)"

      default: formattedDescription(format: "default")
      # Result: "Princess Leia"
    }
  }
}

# Combined usage of all three approaches
query CombinedVariablesDemo {
  node(id: "Q2hhcmFjdGVyOjE=") {  # Luke Skywalker
    ... on Character {
      name

      # @Variable with fromArgument examples
      basicProfile: characterProfile(includeDetails: false)
      detailedProfile: characterProfile(includeDetails: true)

      # VariableProvider with dynamic computation
      youngStats: characterStats(minAge: 0, maxAge: 30)
      oldStats: characterStats(minAge: 30, maxAge: 100)

      # Argument-based conditional logic
      nameOnly: formattedDescription(format: "default")
      yearOnly: formattedDescription(format: "year-only")
      detailed: formattedDescription(format: "detailed")
    }
  }
}
```

### Film Fragment Examples
```graphql
query {
  allFilms(limit: 2) {
    # Standard fields
    title
    director

    # Shorthand fragment - delegates to title
    displayTitle

    # Full fragment - combines episode, title, director
    summary

    # Full fragment - production details
    productionDetails

    # Full fragment with character data
    characterCountSummary
  }
}
```

## Testing
